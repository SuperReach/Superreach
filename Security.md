# Security Policy

This policy outlines Superreach’s security commitments and practices for users across different licensing and deployment models.

## Superreach Users

**Security SLA:** Superreach addresses vulnerabilities according to the following guidelines:

- **Critical:** Typically addressed within 14 days.
- **High:** Typically addressed within 30 days.
- **Medium:** Typically addressed within 90 days.
- **Low:** Typically addressed within 180 days.
- **Informational:** Addressed as necessary.

These timelines are targets and may vary based on specific circumstances.

**Release Schedule:** Updates are deployed to Superreach as vulnerabilities are resolved.

**Version Support:** Superreach always runs the latest version, ensuring up-to-date security fixes.

## Affero General Public License (AGPL) License Users

**Security SLA:** Superreach does not provide a formal SLA for security issues under the AGPL License but aims to address vulnerabilities inline with the SLA for Superreach Users.

**Release Schedule:** Releases prioritise new functionality and include fixes for known security vulnerabilities at the time of release. While major releases typically occur less frequently, Superreach does not guarantee a fixed release schedule.

**Version Support:** Security patches are provided for the latest release version and at Superreach’s discretion for previous versions as deemed necessary.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs via the issue tracker or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to [security@superreachos.com](mailto:security@superreachos.com)
